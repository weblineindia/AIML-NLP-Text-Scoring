# Sentence scoring using NLTK bleu score

A Python based NLP package for generating the best matching text from a paragraph for a given keyword/sentence.
A user can pass a keyword and a paragraph/text content throught the terminal and the paragraph undergoes cleaning process by eliminating special characters from the text,
then preprocessing technique is applied to each sentences by removing stopwords and tokenizing it. 

The sentence score is calculated by applying bleu_score. Here a cumulative bleu score is calculated for the each sentences.The code helps in calculatuing the score of each sentences with reference to the input keyword and top scored 3 sentences are displayed as output.

Regex used for removing special characters from text.<br/>
NLTK stopwords for removing stopwords from sentence.<br/>
NLTK word_tokenize used for tokenization of sentence.<br/>
NLTK WordNetLemmatizer used for lemmatization of words.<br/>
NLTK sentence_bleu used for sentence scoring.<br/>

## Getting started

Prerequisites for running the code are:

Python = 3.5 

nltk = 3.4

or
```
pip install nltk
```

We have tested our program in above version, however you can use it in other versions as well.

## Features

- Performs text cleaning
- Uses nltk's sentence_bleu score for text scoring. 

## Usage

Inside the project's directory run:

```
python app.py
```
Enter keyword and a paragraph.
It will display sentences with most relavent text to the keyword entered.
